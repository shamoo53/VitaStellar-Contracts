# VitaStellar Contracts — Master Threat Model

## Document Overview

This master threat model consolidates all security threat analyses for the VitaStellar medical records smart contract system deployed on Soroban. It provides a comprehensive view of threats across all critical contract operations, with detailed mitigation strategies and security control mappings.

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-25  
**Scope**: All VitaStellar smart contracts (emr_integration, identity_registry, crypto_registry, governor, and related contracts)
**Blockchain**: Soroban (Stellar)  
**Asset Classification**: Critical Healthcare Infrastructure

## LOC Manifest

The fenced `loc-manifest` block below is the authoritative size-of-contract record cited by this threat model. It is validated by `scripts/loc_report.sh --check` (invoked by the `loc-check` CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) against `wc -l` on `contracts/<name>/src/**/*.rs` — tests and `target/` are excluded. Drift fails CI; to update intentionally, regenerate with `./scripts/loc_report.sh --emit-manifest` and paste the result into the block.

```loc-manifest

```

## Executive Summary

The VitaStellar medical records system handles highly sensitive healthcare data requiring the highest levels of security. This threat model identifies and addresses risks across five major categories:

1. **Access Control Threats**: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, emergency access abuse
2. **State Manipulation Threats**: Record tampering, configuration corruption, governance attacks
3. **Resource Exhaustion Threats**: Storage, computation, and event generation attacks
4. **Cryptographic Threats**: Key compromise, algorithm vulnerabilities, quantum computing
5. **Cross-Contract Interaction Threats**: Bridge attacks, dependency exploitation, oracle manipulation

### Key Security Properties

- **Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption with post-quantum readiness
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic hashing and immutable record storage
- **Availability**: Rate limiting and circuit breakers prevent DoS
- **Non-repudiation**: Comprehensive audit logging and digital signatures
- **Governance**: Threshold + timelock controls for all critical changes

### Threat Model Methodology

This document follows STRIDE methodology adapted for blockchain smart contracts:

- **Spoofing**: Identity and authentication threats
- **Tampering**: State and data integrity threats
- **Repudiation**: Audit and logging threats
- **Information Disclosure**: Confidentiality and encryption threats
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion and availability threats
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Access control and authorization threats

## System Architecture

### Core Contracts

The VitaStellar deployment is a graph of focused contracts rather than one monolithic record store. The seven contracts below carry the bulk of the attack surface analyzed in this document; the rest of the workspace (identity, payment, governance auxiliary, telemetry, etc.) is referenced where relevant but not analyzed in depth here. LOC numbers in this section are produced by `scripts/loc_report.sh --check` and validated by CI.

1. **EmrIntegration** (`contracts/emr_integration/`)
   - Primary contract for electronic medical record management
   - Handles record creation, access, and encryption
   - Manages user roles and permissions
   - Integrates ZK proof verification
   - ~2,141 lines of Rust code

2. **IdentityRegistry** (`contracts/identity_registry/`)
   - Decentralized identity and role-based access control
   - Healthcare-specific roles (provider, patient, admin, auditor, …)
   - Permission assignment, attestation, and lookup
   - ~3,601 lines of Rust code

3. **CryptoRegistry** (`contracts/crypto_registry/`)
   - Manages public key infrastructure
   - Supports classical and post-quantum algorithms
   - Key versioning and rotation
   - ~935 lines of Rust code

4. **Governor** (`contracts/governor/`)
   - On-chain governance for upgrades
   - Proposal and voting mechanism
   - Timelock execution
   - ~451 lines of Rust code

5. **MedicalRecordBackup** (`contracts/medical_record_backup/`)
   - Disaster-recovery and off-chain archival
   - Encrypted backup write/read APIs
   - Retention and rotation policies
   - ~1,566 lines of Rust code

6. **Supporting Contracts (analyzed in this document)**
   - HomomorphicRegistry (`contracts/homomorphic_registry/`) — HE computation coordination
   - MPCManager (`contracts/mpc_manager/`) — secure multi-party computation
   - ZKVerifier (`contracts/zk_verifier/`) — zero-knowledge proof verification
   - AuditForensics (`contracts/audit_forensics/`) — security monitoring and forensics

The `check_permission()`, `manage_user()`, and `grant_permission()` function names cited in §1 below are illustrative attack-vector patterns — VitaStellar contracts use Soroban authorization primitives (`require_auth()`, role attributes, capability checks) rather than those specific function names. See `docs/AUTH_PATTERNS.md` for the real API surface.

### Data Flow

```
User → Authentication → Access Control Check → Operation Validation → 
State Update → Event Emission → Cross-Chain Sync (if applicable)
```

### Trust Boundaries

1. **On-Chain (Public)**: All contract state is publicly readable on Soroban
2. **Off-Chain (Private)**: Encrypted medical data stored in IPFS/Arweave/S3
3. **Client Devices**: Key custody and encryption/decryption operations
4. **External Oracles**: Price feeds, identity verification, ZK proof verification
